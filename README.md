### About the Experiment 

The objective of the Metapopulation Dynamics - Levins Model experiment is to explore the behavior of metapopulations using the Levins model, which simulates the dynamics of a population distributed across several patches. Through this experiment, users will investigate key concepts such as local extinction, colonization rates, and the balance between these processes that determine the persistence of species in fragmented habitats. By varying parameters like the colonization rate and extinction rate, participants will understand how different factors influence the long-term survival and spatial distribution of metapopulations. This experiment aims to provide insights into the application of metapopulation theory to real-world ecological scenarios, such as conservation efforts and habitat fragmentation.
